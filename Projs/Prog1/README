Goal: 

    The program  should handle inventory for a book company and be able to perform transactions such as add, delete, change onhand, and change price.

Input and Output: (describe all input and output files)

    The program reads in a master file and a transaction file. It creates two new files, a new master and an errors file. Once the new master is created, it is read through and its contents are put to the screen. The error file contains all errors the program ran into while trying to complete transactions. 

Algorithm Outline:

  1. read master and populate map with isbn's and offsets
  2. perform the transactions
  3. read transaction file
      3a. Use switch statement to complete transactions
  4. Add:
      4a. If file exists, generate error message
      4b. If file doesnt exist, add isbn and byte offset to map
      4c. Write new book record to end of master copy
  5. Delete:
      5a. If record does not exist, generate error message
      5b. Remove book record from map, do not need to do anything to master
  6. ChangeOnhand
      6a. If record does not exist or amount becomes 0, generate error
      6b. If amount becomes negative, make total amount equal 0
      6c. Find original book record, add new amount to book record
      6d. Write over old book record with new one
  7.Change Price
      7a. If record does not exist, generate eror
      7b. If record exists, replace current record with new one
  8. Write to new Master
      8a. Use iterator to loop through book map and write out book records
          to offsets in new master
